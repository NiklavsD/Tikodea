## Key Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-01-16 | Telegram bot as primary input | TikTok account automation is fragile |
| 2026-01-16 | All 4 lenses on every video | User wants comprehensive analysis, not routing |
| 2026-01-16 | Gemini 2.0 Flash for LLM | Cheapest multimodal, <$0.01/video |
| 2026-01-16 | SQLite + Drizzle ORM | Zero-config, perfect for personal use |
| 2026-01-16 | YOLO mode workflow | Minimal confirmation gates |

## Blockers

None currently.

## Notes

- TikTok scraping (Phase 3) flagged as highest risk — surfaces early intentionally
- Phases 6 and 7 can run in parallel after Phase 5
- Research recommended for Phase 3 (scraping) and Phase 4 (LLM prompts)
